Create proportional fonts for Waveshare E-Paper displays for use with C/C++ applications

Waveshare provides a good sample application in Python to create any size proportional fonts but the sample application for C/C++ has very limited fonts in bitmap files that are non-proportional. This repository includes a Python program to create any size proportional font files that can be read and displayed in a C/C++ application.
